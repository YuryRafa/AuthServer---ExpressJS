An authentication server built with Node.js and the Express.js framework, using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and bcrypt for password encryption. This project aims to implement a simple user authentication system with a login, registration, and route protection system in a web application, integrating with a MySQL/MariaDB database and using dotenv to manage environment variables, all ensuring security. it also includes user roles, such as admin and regular user, with admin authentication handled manually to provide an role-based access control.
