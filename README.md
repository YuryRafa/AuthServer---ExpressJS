# AuthServer in ExpressJS – Role-Based Authentication with JWT and MySQL

An authentication server built with Node.js and the Express.js framework, using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and bcrypt for password encryption. This project implements a simple user authentication system featuring login, registration, and protected routes within a web application. It integrates with a MySQL/MariaDB database and uses dotenv to manage environment variables, ensuring persistent data storage and improved security. The project also includes user roles, such as admin and regular user, with admin authentication handled manually to demonstrate a basic implementation of role-based access control (RBAC).
